# The Typeclassopedia
Advanced Haskell is a lot like modern philosophy. To the uninitiated (which includes most of us), reading it is baffling to no end, and there is little to no financial incentive for putting in the hours/days/weeks necessary to gain some insight. As such, serious practitioners are few and far between, and more likely to be found sitting in dark and dusty offices in various computer science deparments rather than the sensually lit workstations of Silicon Valley. Though I do not expect to convince you that this should be otherwise in one day, I do hope to provide insight into the utility of a Haskellian background as the weeks go on.

This lecture is, like most Haskell lectures, an unusual one, and leans heavily upon a foundational text in the Haskell community. The *Typeclassopedia* is a 30-odd page document written by a PhD student at UPenn, Brent Yorgey. While

## Why Haskell?
With most Computer Science courses, the reason for taking it is generally fairly obvious: Why take Databases, Networks, Operating Systems, or Parallel Programming? Because these are the fundamental building blocks of systems programming. Why take Discrete Math and Algorithms? Because you need to know the fundamentals of reasoning about program runtime and performance. Why take Complexity? Because you need to graduate. But with a topic this seemingly esoteric, it is probably worthwhile to take a moment and think about why we're doing this.

Initially, our motivation for teaching this course was to be able to explore more advanced topics in Haskell and further cultivate the Haskell community at the university. This is all well and good, but it only goes so far in convincing folks that this is a good idea.

Haskell is a pretty
