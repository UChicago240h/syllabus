<h1>Lecture 1: A Haskell Refresher</h1>
<h2>Administrivia</a>
<p>Please note material on the course <a href="http://cmsc-22311.cs.uchicago.edu/2015/">Home Page</a>.

<h2>Expectations and Goals</h2>
<p>This course is designed with the expectation that everyone here has an understanding of Haskell equivalent to completing CMSC 16100. While we will be doing a refresher of this material, it will be brief and far from equivalent to a complete, quarter-long exposure to Haskell. While we do welcome folks who are self-taught in Haskell or have managed to learn Haskell elsewhere, we do expect an understanding of and capacity in Haskell up to at least monadic computation. If you have not taken 16100 but are still interested in taking this course, please speak to either Professor Kurtz or myself sometime after class.</p>

<p>This course is designed as a follow-up to CMSC 16100, exploring topics in Haskell with the goal of creating workable software in the language. While much Haskell literature focuses on the theoretical foundations of the language, our goal here is to provide you guys with a powerful enough toolset to create applications more robust than a string of pure computations bookended by some rudimentary IO.</p>

<p>While there is a growing field of Haskell writing that focuses on writing software meant to exist in the wild, much of this writing is scattered across various blog posts that occasionally bubble up in Hacker News. As such, our secondary, and much more ambitious goal, is to create some kind of unified resource for advanced, systems-driven programming in Haskell. We hope that this class can begin serving this end. Due to the experimental nature of this, we'd like to come into this with the expectation that much of this material is (at best) in beta mode, from both the pedagogical and software perspective. There will be rough patches, things will break, and we will get things wrong. Come into this class with a tolerance for these problems, and we will do our best to reward your patience.</p>

<h2>A Gentle Start</h2>

<p>Let's begin with the basics. Haskell is a strong, statically typed, pure functional language that is lazily evaluated. This pretty much covers most of what you need to know, but we'll spend the better part of this lecture unraveling what these statements mean.</p>

<p>Let's start with some basic computations and move into the type system. Let's jump into some examples. For these, let's boot up GHCi.</p>
<code>
> let height = 5
> let width = 10
> width * height
50
> width - height
5
</code>

<p>Nothing shocking here: we can perform basic calculations and perform what seems like variable bindings. Let's go ahead and define a function:</p>

<code>
> let area h w = h * w
> area height width
50
</code>

<p>Once again, we're not starting any revolutions here. We've defined a function. But let's start taking a look at the types of what we've defined. Before we begin, formulate what you expect the types of <code>height</code>, <code>width</code>, and <code>area</code> to be. Now, let's go ahead and check each of these out:</p>

<code>
> :t width
Num a => a
> :t height
Num a => a
> :t area
Num a => a -> a -> a
</code>

<p>Okay, that's a little unexpected. For those of us</a>
<h2>Hitting the Ground Running</h2>
<p>I'm of the belief that good problems get us to great solutions, so we're going to begin with a classic: the <strong><a href="#">maximum subarray problem</a></strong>. Formally stated, (ripped directly from Wikipedia), "the maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimentional array of numbers (containing at least one positive number) which has the largest sum."</p>

<p>Our task is going to be to use what we've learned thus far to write a function that calculates and returns the maximum sum subarray given a list of numbers. By the end of this lecture, we'll have created a command line tool that takes a in a text file as input, finds the max-sum subarray of each line, and outputs each of these subarrays to a file.</p>

<code>
import Data.List (inits, tails, maximumBy)
import Data.Ord (comparing)

subseqs :: [a] -> [[a]]
subsequs = concatMap inits . tails

maxsubseq :: (Ord a, Num a) => [a] -> [a]
maxsubseq = maximumBy (comparing sum) . subseqs

main :: IO ()
main =  print $ maxsubseq [-1, -2, 3, 5, 6, -2, -1, 4, -4, 2, -1]
</code>

<code>
maxsubseq = snd . foldl f ((0,[]),(0,[])) where
        f ((h1,h2),sofar) x = (a,b) where
                a = max (0,[]) (h1 + x, h2 ++ [x])
                b = max sofar a

main = print $ maxsubseq [-1, -2, 3, 5, 6, -2, -1, 4, -4, 2, -1]
</code>

<h1>Lecture 1</h1>
<h2>Haskell</h2>
<p>As all Haskell courses begin, so does this one: with the most banal description of the language possible. **Haskell is a lazy pure functional language.** What this means, I'm assuming most of you know already: if you don't, this course is probably not for you. At the highest level, this means that Haskell is very, very, very different from most programming languages that you have worked with previously. We'll get into the details of the weirdness in a bit, with much of it hopefully being familiar.</p>

<h2>Today's Goals</h2>
<p>Much of this first week is concerned with covering the groundwork necessary to understand the more advanced topics in class. We're making the assumption that folks here are familiar with Haskell and need no more than a refresher, so much of the material is going to be covered in a cursory fashion and a very rapid speed.</p>

<h2>Beginning with GHC(i)</h2>
<p>Our base of operations in the Haskell world is going to be the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). While there are other Haskell compilers out there, GHC is the standard and the only thing you should ever touch. Initially, as we're experimenting and refamiliarizing ourselves with the language, we're going to spend a significant amount of time in GHCi, the interpreter facility of GHC. For readers of the notes, I've denoted lines of code to be executed within GHCi as preceded by `>` and output in GHCi with no preceding symbol.</p>

<p>Let's begin by mucking about and defining some variables:</p>
<code>
  > let height = 5
  > let width = 10
  > width * height
  50
  > width - height
  5
</code>

<p>Note that function invocation, as opposed to what most of us are used to from Algol-family languages, does not depend upon the use of parentheses, but properly-spaced function names followed by arguments. Let's go about and define a couple of slightly more robust functions:</p>
<code>
  > let isLong name = (length name) > 10
  > isLong "Jakub"
  False
  > isLong "Balthazarius"
  True
</code>

<p>Very cool. Just a quick word about GHCi before we go any further: the `let` keyword has a very different meaning in GHCi and in proper Haskell. In GHCi, we use `let` to define bindings that remain within the interpreter's scope for the duration of the session. We use this for both variables and functions. In proper Haskell, `let` is used in a very different way to denote local name bindings. We'll cover this latter use in a bit.</p>

<h2>Types</h2>
<p>Haskell's type system is simultaneously its most powerful and most irritating feature. Type safety allows us to write hugely robust programs, but often at the expense of accessibility to n00bz. If you have not already, you will spend a significant amount of time tearing your hair out over type signatures. Let's take begin previous example, which we'll put in a file called *area.hs*:</p>
<code>
  -- area.hs
  getArea :: Int -> Int -> Int
  getArea width height = width * height
</code>

<p>Here we've defined the getArea function as before, but with the addition of a type signature. Type signatures provide an explicit type restrictions for function inputs and outputs. While the compiler can usually infer types for basic functions, type signatures provide an added layer readability for folks reading your code down the road and are critical for more advaned programs. They can also become a huge liability if not done properly. Let's load this file into GHCi and give it a whirl:</p>
<code>
  > :l area.hs
  > getArea 4 5
  20
</code>

<p>This works as before, but the limitations of what we've written become apparent very quickly:</p>
<code>
  > getArea 4.0 8
  INCOMPREHENSIBLE ERROR MESSAGE
</code>

<p>This is obviously not something we want. It should only make sense that our `getArea` function should be able to handle floating point numbers, but we've defined our function signature to handle only integers. To fix this issue, let's try removing method signature and reloading our function:</p>

<code>
  -- area.hs
  getArea width height = width * height
</code>
<code>
  > :l area.hs
  > getArea 4 5.0
  20.0
</code>

<p>This is mysterious. By simply removing the type signature, something that we've created a function that works on previously failing data types and is somehow more robust than our previous, virtually identical function. Let's investigate why:</p>

<code>
  > :t getArea
  getArea :: Num a => a -> a -> a
</code>

<p>Interesting. The interpreter has assessed the type of our function to be quite different from what initially profiled it as. The core is the same: you're working with a function taking in two arguments of the same type and returning an argument of the same type: `a -> a -> a`. But while our previous types were strictly defined as integers, GHCi has has reprofiled these types as generics. The only restriction upon these types is denoted by `Num a =>`, which means that all of these variables must be of the `Num` typeclass (more on these later). This means that all types that could be considered numbers and obey certain laws that the Haskell compiler places upon Nums are admissible in both the arguments and ouput. We can go ahead and use this information to amend our previous function defintion:</p>

<code>
  -- area.hs
  getArea :: Num a => a -> a -> a
  getArea width height = width * height
</code>

<p>Let's load this and make sure it works:</p>
<code>
  > :l area.hs
  > getArea 2.0 4
  20.0
</code>

<p>Awesome. There's plenty more to be said for this example, but we'll leave it as is for the time being. There's plenty more to be said about Haskell's type system, much of which we'll cover down the line. Truth be told, the system is so omnipresent and powerful that a lot of beginner Haskellians spend much of their time struggling within its confines. More will be said about this type system, but for now, trust me when I say that it is worth taking the time to master this system and really understand how your types are functioning.</p>

<h2>Control Flow</h2>
<p>Haskell's take on control flow far outstrips what we're used to seeing with the standard Algol-family *if-then-else* constructs. Haskell provides us with a number of takes on control flow that encompass function overloading, case statements, and the standard *if-then* constructs that we're used to. Let's jump in with pattern matching.</p>

<h3>Pattern Matching</h3>
<p>Haskell's pattern matching capabilities may be most analogous for most folks to Java's function overloading capabilities, but in reality are far more similar to the list deconstruction capabilities found in Lisp (i.e. Common Lisp, Racket, Scheme, Clojure, etc.). Let's take a look by defining a greeting function which properly handles folks we know, dislike, and don't know:</p>

<code>
  -- greeting.hs
  greeting :: String -> String
  greeting "" = "Hey Henry, let's go drinking today!"
  greeting "Hazel" = "Hey Hazel, are we actually working on OS today?"
  greeting "Laura" = "Hey Laura, we should just probably start that project today!"
  greeting _ = "I don't know you bro."
</code>

<code>
  > :l greeting.hs
  > greeting "Henry"
  "Hey Henry, let's go drinking today!"
  > greeting "Shaan"
  "I don't know you bro."
</code>

<p>As you can see, we're creating instances of our function that have different behaviors upon explicitly defined input patterns. Truth be told, there's no need to be *this* explicit about our inputs: we'll see how we can have more generalizable pattern matching once we start working with lists. One thing that should be noted is the last case. We utilize the `_` character to denote a general wildcard pattern. This takes the place of an `otherwise`, or `else` pattern.</p>

<p>We can use this in a slightly smarter way. Let's say we wanted to pattern-match for individuals whose names start with an 'S', simply so we can ostracize them. We can do this using a clever pattern-matching construct:</p>

<code>
  -- ostracize.hs
  ostracize :: String -> String
  ostracize ('S':_) = "Only fools have a name that starts with S!"
  ostracize ('J':_) = "Ha! John? Jacob? Jingleheimer? More like Jerk!"
  ostracize _ = "I don't have time for you bro."
</code>

<h3>Guards</h3>
Pattern matching is well and good, but oftentimes we want to have conditionals more conveniently nested in our function, rather than the top-level routing that pattern matching provides. For example, let's take a function that tells me whether or not I should stop drinking
<code>
  keepDrinking :: Int -> String
  keepDrinking numDrinks
    | numDrinks < 3 = "Keep on chugging"
    | numDrinks < 6 = "You should probably slow down"
    | numDrinks < 9 = "You should probably stop"
    | otherwise     = "You should probably call an ambulance"
</code>

<p>Here, we're creating more explicit conditional statements that map to program outputs. Rather than the pattern matching, we're able to create conditional statements that allow for true/false evaluation within...</p>

<h3>List Comprehensions</h3>
<p>List comprehensions are one of the most efficient ways we have available to us of constructing lists. If you're a serious Pythonista, you've probably seen these once or twice, but Haskell's take on them is much closer to the way that set construction is dealt with in math:</p>
<code>
  > [x*2 | x <- [1..20]]
  [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]
</code>

<p>As you can see, this takes each element within the range `[1..10]`, doubles it, and adds it to the list. We can spice this up by adding conditional predicates to this:</p>
<code>
  > [x*2 | x <- [1..20], x*2 >= 12]
  [12,14,16,18,20]
</code>

<p>We can further spice this up by having multiple predicates:</p>
<code>
  > [x | x <- [10..20], x /= 13, x /= 15, x /= 19]
  [10,11,12,14,16,17,18,20]
</code>

<p>And we can also perform comprehensions over several lists:</p>

<code>
  > [ x*y | x <- [2,5,10], y <- [8,10,11]]
  [16, 20,22,40,50,55,80,100,110]
</code>

<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>Haskell's take on lists is quite a bit different than what we're used to in imperative languages. Firstly, access time is not constant, but linear. Additionally, lists are constructed in a way that iterative traversal is impossible, forcing us to rely on recursion. Let's take a look at some of these details:</p>
<code>
  > let lostNumbers = [4,8,15,16,23,42]
  > lostNumbers
  [4,8,15,16,23,42]
</code>

<p>Awesome. Let's now construct this list in a completely different way, using the const `:` operator:</p>
<code>
  > let newNumbers = (4:(8:(15:(16:(23:(42:[]))))))
  > newNumbers
  [4,8,15,16,23,42]
</code>

<p>As we can see here, lists are really successive applications of a binary, left-associative appending operator, thus suggesting that much of our list traversal is going to involve peeling elements from the beginning of a list, rather than the iterative type of traversal.</p>

<h2>Local Bindings</h2>
<p>While the Haskell way is to prevent data from being assigned to temporary placeholders, sometimes we do need to alias certain data points to keep our code clean. Take the following example:</p>
<code>
  -- bmi.hs
  bmiTell :: (RealFloat a) => a -> a -> String
  bmiTell weight height
    | weight / height ^ 2 <= 18.5  = "You're underweight!"
    | weight / height ^ 2 <= 25.0  = "You're supposedly normal."
    | weight / height ^ 2 <= 30.0  = "You're fat!"
    | otherwise                    = "You're a whale!"
</code>

<p>We can see that we repeat the `weight / height ^ 2` clause three separate times, so let's see if we can't alias that away:</p>

<code>
  -- bmi.hs
  bmiTell :: (RealFloat a) => a -> a -> String
  bmiTell weight height
    | bmi <= 18.5  = "You're underweight!"
    | bmi <= 25.0  = "You're supposedly normal."
    | bmi <= 30.0  = "You're fat!"
    | otherwise    = "You're a whale!"
    where bmi = weight / height ^ 2
</code>

<p>Awesome, that simplifies our code hugely. Now let's further alias the numerical values here to make a bit more sense of them:</p>

<code>
  -- bmi.hs
  bmiTell :: (RealFloat a) => a -> a -> String
  bmiTell weight height
    | bmi <= skinny  = "You're underweight!"
    | bmi <= normal  = "You're supposedly normal."
    | bmi <= fat     = "You're fat!"
    | otherwise      = "You're a whale!"
    where bmi = weight / height ^ 2
          skinny = 18.5
	  normal = 25.0
	  fat = 30.0
</code>

<p>Awesome, our function is a lot clearer and more readable thanks to our `where` bindings. Now, while this is a </p>

<h2>Recursion</h2>
<p>The vast majority of CS students (at other, more sane institutions) learned about looping by way of the glorious `for` and `while` loops. But we're insufferable hipsters, so we learned about recursion. Since Haskell doesn't allow us to mutate variables or global state, we are pretty much limited to working with various forms of traversable objects (`Functor`, `Foldable`, `Traversable`, etc.). Recursion works pretty much exactly like you'd expect it to:</p>
<code>
  fibonacci :: Int -> Int
  fibonacci 0 = 0
  fibonacci 1 = 1
  fibonacci n = fibonacci (n-2) + fibonacci (n-1)
</code>

<p>Now, while this is unsurprising, it is inefficient. As in most basic fibonacci implementations, we're recomputing an enormous amount of values, thus causing a huge performance hit. Just to illustrate, let's try actually running this:</p>

<code>
  -- fibonacci.hs
  fibonacci :: Int -> Integer
  fibonacci 0 = 0
  fibonacci 1 = 1
  fibonacci n = fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2)

  main = do
    print $ fibonacci 40
</code>

<code>
  $ ghc fibonacci.hs
  $ time ./fibonacci
  102334155

  real  0m10.601s
  user  0m10.560s
  sys   0m0.047s
</code>

<p>At this point, we're taking slightly north of 10 seconds for calculating a fibonacci number. Suffice it to say, this will not scale. But we know we can improve this with some basic memoization. Just to make sure we're all on the same page, much of the issue here stems from the fact that we're recursively recalculating multiple fibonacci values. We can solve this by caching our intermediary values in some kind of data structure that supports constant-time lookup, thus allowing us to skip the recalculation steps that are adding so much to the runtime.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, memoization in imperative languages generally involves mutating some global data structure and then performing lookups and inserts based on the status of that global data structure. As an example, let's consider the memoized problem in Python:</p>

<code>
  fib_vals = {}
  def fibonacci_memo(n):
    if n == 0:
      return 0
    if n == 1:
      return 1
    if n in fib_vals:
      return fib_vals[n]
    fib_vals[n] = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
    return fib_vals[n]
</code>

<p>As you can see, the entire memoization procedure depends upon our mutation of a globally-accessible data structure. While this is all well and good, we really can't do this in Haskell, thus forcing us to be a more creative. Before we can make this happen, we need to look back and recall the `map` function.</p>

<h2>Map</h2>
<p>One of the beautiful things about Haskell is how we can utilize higher-order functions. In most imperative languages that we're familiar with, functions only go so far as their explicit definition, and are extensible only to the extent of their type signatures, if even that. Haskell allows us a whole host of magical capacities to play with functions. The first of these is the ability to curry functions, that is to create partially applied functions. As a result of this, we can create functions that are effectively function generators:</p>

<code>
  mulFunc :: Num a => a -> a -> a
  mulFunc a = (* a)

  > let double = mulFunc 2
  > double 4
  8
</code>

<p>Awesome, so we can create functions that generate more functions. Now, let's say we want to take this function and apply it to multiple arguments within a list. In order to make this happen, we can create a function that takes in said list and function, and sequentially applies the function to each element within the list. As such, we can write a map function in the canonical Haskell way:</p>

<code>
  map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
  map _ [] = []
  map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
</code>

<p>For those of you that haven't seen this before, note that all we're doing is pattern matching and generating sequential recursive applications via list decomposition. As far as using this, let's say we wanted to take a list and double all elements within it:</p>

<code>
  > map (*2) [2..10]
  [4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]
</code>

<p>Fairly basic stuff: we've managed to double each number in the list by mapping over it. Let's try a couple more things:</p>
<code>
  > map (++ "!") ["BIFF", "BANG", "POW"]
  ["BIFF!", "BANG!", "POW!"]
  > map (replicate 3) [3..6]
  [[3,3,3],[4,4,4],[5,5,5],[6,6,6]]
  > map (map (^2)) [[1,2],[3,4,5,6],[7,8]]
  [[1,4],[9,16,25,36],[49,64]]
  > map (!! 1) [[1,2],[3,4,5,6],[7,8]]
  [2,4,8]
</code>

<p>Do note the `!!` operator. This operator defines explicit indexing in Haskell. This is far less commonly used in Haskell than many other languages, since array indexing is actually an `O(n)` operation, rather than the `O(1)` operation we're used to.</p>

## Memoizing
Now that we've gotten a good understanding of maps, let's go ahead and think about how we can utilize this for memoization. While we can't create mutable data structures, we can create a recursively defined list that effectively caches intermediary values, and then map our fibonacci function over that list. We can even make this an infinite list, since, due to Haskell's lazy evaluation, only the values up to the value of interest will actually be evaluated.
<code>
-- fibonacci_memo
  fibonacci :: Int -> Integer
  fibonacci = (map fib [0..] !!)
    where fib 0 = 0
          fib 1 = 1
          fib n = fibonacci (n-1) + fibonacci (n-2)

  main = do
    print $ fibonacci 40
</code>

<p>Note both the use of the `!!` operator, and the `[0..]` infinite range. As we mentioned before, Haskell's lazy evaluation allows us to utilize such infinite ranges without loss of performance. The locally defined `fib` function, combined with the map, allows us to get our runtime down from `O(n!)` to `O(n)`. We can see that results by explicitly timing our program:</p>

<code>
  $ ghc fibonacci_memo.hs
  $ time ./fibonacci_memo
  102334155

  real  0m0.002s
  user  0m0.000s
  sys   0m0.000s
</code>

<p>This, to say the least, is a not-insignificant improvement. But we can still do better. Let's consider...</p>

<h2>Data Types</h2>
<p>Let's finish up by pushing our fibonacci calculator as far as we possibly can. Right now, we've gotten our runtime down to `O(n)`, but there is a way to further shave our runtime down to `O(log n)`.</p>

<p>If we write the equations F_1 = F_1 and F_2 = F_0 + F_1 in matrix notation, we get:</p>
<ul class="open-list">
  <li>$\begin{bmatrix} F_1 \\ F_2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 1 & 1 1 \\ F_0 & F_1\end{bmatrix}$</li>
  <li>$\begin{bmatrix}F_2 \\ F_3\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}F_1 \\ F_2\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1\end{bmatrix}^2 \cdot \begin{bmatrix}F_0 \\ F_1\end{bmatrix}</li> 
</ul>

<p>More generally, we have:</p>
<ul class="open-list">
  <li>\begin{bmatrix}F_n \\ F_n+1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1)^n \cdot \begin{bmatrix}F_0 & F_1\end{bmatrix}</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, we can use fast exponentiation to break down our calculating `f^n` in `O(log n)` time. As an example, let's see this via python:</p>
<code>
  def pow(base, power):
    if power == 0:
      return 1
    if power % 2 == 0:
      return pow(base*base, power/2)
    return base * pow(base, power-1)
</code>

<p>Due to recursive halving of the power, we're able to get this runtime down to `O(log n)` runtime. Now, let's combine this with our initial insight about exploiting matrix multiplication to get a close-to-ideal version of fibonacci:</p>

<p>First, we need to define a matrix datatype. We can easily do this by way of Haskell's ability to define datatypes:</p>

<code>
  data GL2 = GL2 Integer Integer Integer Integer
</code>

<p>Now, let's define a matrix multiplication routine:</p>

<code>
  mul :: GL2 -> GL2 -> GL2
  mul (GL2 a b c d) (GL2 e f g h) = GL2 (a*e+b*g) (a*f+b*h) (c*e+d*g) (c*f+d*h)
</code>

<p>We can now utilize this machinery to create a recursive definition of recursive exponentiation:</p>
<code>
  fastexp :: GL2 -> Int -> GL2
  fastexp _ 0 = GL2 1 0 0 1
  fastexp a 1 = a
  fastexp a n
    | even n = fastexp (mul a a) (div n 2)
    | otherwise = mul a (fastexp a (n-1))
</code>

<p>We now have our recursive definition dividing the power by 2 at each point, while squaring the matrix at each point there's an even power. Now, we just need to add on the machinery and run the program:</p>
<code>
  fib :: Int -> Integer
  fib n = b
    where GL2 a b _ _ = fastexp (GL2 1 1 1 0) n

  main = do
    print $ fib 40
</code>

<p>Now let's run and time the program:</p>

<code>
  $ ghc fibonacci_matrix.hs
  $ time ./fibonacci_matrix

  real   0m0.004s
  user   0m0.000s
  sys    0m0.003s
</code>

<p>So the actual runtime is slightly greater than our memoized version, most likely due to the overhead of having to calculate matrix multiplications. But, algorithmically, we can't get much better than this.</p>

<p>Next time, we'll be covering the Typeclassopaedia, so be ready for monads, functors, and applicatives.</p>
