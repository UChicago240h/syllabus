<h1>Lecture 1: A Haskell Refresher</h1>
<h2>Administrivia</a>
<p>Please note material on the course <a href="http://cmsc-22311.cs.uchicago.edu/2015/">Home Page</a>.

<h2>Expectations and Goals</h2>
<p>This course is designed with the expectation that everyone here has an understanding of Haskell equivalent to completing CMSC 16100. While we will be doing a refresher of this material, it will be brief and far from equivalent to a complete, quarter-long exposure to Haskell. While we do welcome folks who are self-taught in Haskell or have managed to learn Haskell elsewhere, we do expect an understanding of and capacity in Haskell up to at least monadic computation. If you have not taken 16100 but are still interested in taking this course, please speak to either Professor Kurtz or myself sometime after class.</p>

<p>This course is designed as a follow-up to CMSC 16100, exploring topics in Haskell with the goal of creating workable software in the language. While much Haskell literature focuses on the theoretical foundations of the language, our goal here is to provide you guys with a powerful enough toolset to create applications more robust than a string of pure computations bookended by some rudimentary IO.</p>

<p>While there is a growing field of Haskell writing that focuses on writing software meant to exist in the wild, much of this writing is scattered across various blog posts that occasionally bubble up in Hacker News. As such, our secondary, and much more ambitious goal, is to create some kind of unified resource for advanced, systems-driven programming in Haskell. We hope that this class can begin serving this end. Due to the experimental nature of this, we'd like to come into this with the expectation that much of this material is (at best) in beta mode, from both the pedagogical and software perspective. There will be rough patches, things will break, and we will get things wrong. Come into this class with a tolerance for these problems, and we will do our best to reward your patience.</p>
